# FICM: Force Informed Cell Map 
FICM: Force Informed Cell Map Image Synthesis using Attention-gated Dual Encoder U-Net for Carcinoma Cell Line Classification    

- Carcinoma Cell Line Classification Problem: **HCC827** & **A549** are two types of lungadenocarcinomacell lines that display different aggressiveness behaviors. Though they can be separated via staining, different staining methods may influence their actual behaviors. Furthermore, cellular morphology can be completely stochastic, **making it very challenging and highly subjective to separate them via fluorescence signals using the naked eye.**
- In our research, we propose a **new medical image modality** that combined a cell's morphological feature with its internal force gradients captured with force-sensing chips. Our prroposed modality is able to enhance classification accuracy by 37.67% compared to unprocessed modalities.
